* Agenda

Today we're going to take a look at techniques for writing high performance Go applications.

We're going to focus on three areas in this presentation:

- Benchmarking
- Performance measurement and profiling
- Memory management and GC

The goal is to give you, the audience, the tools you need to measure and improve the performance of your Go applications.

* Benchmarking

* Benchmarking

Before you can begin to tune your application, you need to establish a reliable baseline to measure the impact of your change to know if you're making things better, or worse.

In other words, _"Don't_guess,_measure"_

This section focuses on how to construct useful benchmarks using the Go testing framework, and gives practical tips for avoiding the pitfalls.


* Benchmarking ground rules

Before you benchmark, you must have a stable environment to get repeatable results.

- The machine must be idle—don't profile on shared hardware, don't browse the web while waiting for a long benchmark to run.
- Watch out for power saving and thermal scaling.
- Avoid virtual machines and shared cloud hosting; they are too noisy for consistent measurements.


* Go's Test Package

The testing package has built-in support for benchmarking  

.code examples/factorial/factorial_test.go /STARTFAC OMIT/,/ENDFAC OMIT/
.caption factorial.go

.code examples/factorial/factorial_test.go /STARTBEN OMIT/,/ENDBEN OMIT/
.caption factorial_benchmark.go

DEMO: go test -bench=. 


* How Benchmark work

- Each benchmark is run `b.N` times. By default go increases b.N till the benchmark function takes 1 second to complete.

 % go test -bench=. ./examples/factorial
 goos: linux
 goarch: amd64
 pkg: github.com/kanapuliAthavan/techxexotel/examples/factorial
 BenchmarkFactorial-4   	20000000	        60.1 ns/op
 PASS
 ok  	 github.com/kanapuliAthavan/techxexotel/examples/factorial	1.270s

- Run benchmarks longer to get more accuracy; 
  go test -benchtime=10s
- Benchmarks should be run multiple times to get an average result; 
  go test -bench=. -count=10

* Comparing Benchmarks 

Determining the performance delta between two sets of benchmark is tedious 

 % go test -bench=. -count=10 | tee old.txt

DEMO: Improved Factorial code

 % go test -bench=. -count=10 | tee new.txt

Tools like [[https://godoc.org/rsc.io/benchstat][rsc.io/benchstat]] are useful in comparing the benchmarks

 % go get -u rsc.io/benchstat
 % benchstat {old,new}.txt

 name         old time/op  new time/op  delta
 Factorial-4  63.3ns ± 0%  60.0ns ± 0%  -5.20%  (p=0.000 n=10+10)

* Avoid benchmarking start up costs

Sometimes your benchmark has a once per run setup cost. `b.ResetTimer()` will can be used to ignore the time accrued in setup.

.code examples/reset/reset.go /START1 OMIT/,/END1 OMIT/

If you have some expensive setup logic _per_loop_iteration_, use `b.StopTimer()` and `b.StartTimer()` to pause the benchmark timer.

.code examples/reset/reset.go /START2 OMIT/,/END2 OMIT/

* Benchmarking allocations

Allocation count and size is strongly correlated with benchmark time.

You can tell the `testing` framework to record the number of allocations made by code under test.
 
.code examples/benchmarks/benchmark.go

* Avoid string concatenation

Go strings are immutable. Concatenating two strings generates a third. Which of the following is fastest? 

.code examples/concat/concat_test.go /START1 OMIT/,/END1 OMIT/
.code examples/concat/concat_test.go /START2 OMIT/,/END2 OMIT/
.code examples/concat/concat_test.go /START3 OMIT/,/END3 OMIT/
.code examples/concat/concat_test.go /START4 OMIT/,/END4 OMIT/

* Watch out for compiler optimisations

This example comes from [[https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14813#issue-140603392][issue 14813]].

.code examples/popcnt/popcnt_test.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

How fast will this function benchmark?

 % go test -bench=. ./examples/popcnt

* What happened?

`popcnt` is a leaf function, so the compiler can inline it.

Because the function is inlined, the compiler can see it has no side effects, so the call is eliminated. This is what the compiler sees:

.code examples/popcnt/popcnt2_test.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

The same optimisations that make real code fast, by removing unnecessary computation, are the same ones that remove benchmarks that have no observable side effects.

This is only going to get more common as the Go compiler improves.

DEMO: show how to fix popcnt

* Performance measurement and profiling

* Performance measurement and profiling

`testing.B` is useful for _microbenchmarks_.

Microbenchmarks are useful for tuning the performance of a hot piece of code, but it's impractical (and unreliable) to write a `testing.B` benchmark for entire programs–you'd get more reliable results with `time(1)`.

In this section we'll explore the profiling tools built into Go to investigate the operation of the program from the inside.

* pprof

The first tool we're going to be talking about today is _pprof_.

[[https://github.com/google/pprof][pprof]] descends from the [[https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools][Google Perf Tools]] suite.

`pprof` profiling is built into the Go runtime.

It consists of two parts:

- `runtime/pprof` package built into every Go program
- `go`tool`pprof` for investigating profiles.

* CPU profiling

CPU profiling is the most common type of profile, and the most obvious. 

When CPU profiling is enabled the runtime will interrupt itself every 10ms and record the stack trace of the currently running goroutines.

Once the profile is complete we can analyse it to determine the hottest code paths.

The more times a function appears in the profile, the more time that code path is taking as a percentage of the total runtime.

* Memory profiling

Memory profiling records the stack trace when a _heap_ allocation is made.

Stack allocations are assumed to be free and are _not_tracked_ in the memory profile.


* Other supported profiles

Block profiling is similar to a CPU profile, but it records the amount of time a goroutine spent waiting for a shared resource.

Block profiling can show you when a large number of goroutines _could_ make progress, but were _blocked_. This can be useful for determining _concurrency_ bottlenecks in your application. Blocking includes:

- Sending or receiving on a unbuffered channel.
- Sending to a full channel, receiving from an empty one.
- Trying to `Lock` a `sync.Mutex` that is locked by another goroutine.

`Mutex` `profiling` records the stack traces of the _holder_ of a contended mutex.

`Thread` `creation` `profiling` records the stack traces that led to the creation of new OS threads.

* Profiling applications

The Go runtime's profiling interface is in the `runtime/pprof` package.

`runtime/pprof` is a very low level tool, and for historic reasons the interfaces to the different kinds of profile are not uniform.

A few years ago I wrote a small package, [[https://github.com/pkg/profile][github.com/pkg/profile]], to make it easier to profile an application.

     import "github.com/pkg/profile"

     func main() {
                defer profile.Start().Stop()
		           ...
			        
     }

* Profiling godoc

DEMO: add CPU profiling to `Homeopathix GO`.

1. edit `cd ~/go/src/bitbucket.org/exotel/exotel_code/commonix/homeopathix/go/main.go`, add 

    defer profile.Start(profile.CPUProfile).Stop()
2. run `go`run`main.go`
3. `go`tool`pprof`$PROFILE`

* Profiling benchmarks

The `testing` package has built in support for generating CPU, memory, and block profiles.

- `-cpuprofile=$FILE` writes a CPU profile to `$FILE`. 
- `-memprofile=$FILE`, writes a memory profile to `$FILE`, `-memprofilerate=N` adjusts the profile rate to `1/N`.
- `-blockprofile=$FILE`, writes a block profile to `$FILE`.

_Example_: Running benchmarks of the `bytes` package.

    % go test -run=XXX -bench=. -cpuprofile=c.p bytes
    % go tool pprof c.p

_Note:_ use `-run=XXX` to disable tests, you only want to profile benchmarks. You can also use `-run=^$` to accomplish the same thing.


* Memory management and GC

* Memory management and GC

Go is a garbage collected language. This is a design principle, it will not change.

As a garbage collected language, the performance of Go programs is often determined by their interaction with the garbage collector.

Next to your choice of algorithms, memory consumption is the most important factor that determines the performance and scalability of your application.

This section discusses the operation of the garbage collector and strategies for lowering memory usage if garbage collector performance is a bottleneck.


* Garbage collector design

The design of the Go GC has changed over the years

- Go 1.0, stop the world mark sweep collector based heavily on tcmalloc.
- Go 1.3, fully precise collector, wouldn't mistake big numbers on the heap for pointers, thus leaking memory.
- Go 1.5, new GC design, focusing on _latency_ over _throughput_.
- Go 1.6, GC improvements, handling larger heaps with lower latency.
- Go 1.7, small GC improvements, mainly refactoring.
- Go 1.8–1.9, further work to reduce STW times, now down to the 100 microsecond range.
- Go 1.10, ROC collector is an experiment to extend the idea of escape analysis per goroutine.


* Garbage collector monitoring

A simple way to obtain a general idea of how hard the garbage collector is working is to enable the output of GC logging.

These stats are always collected, but normally suppressed, you can enable their display by setting the `GODEBUG` environment variable.

 % env GODEBUG=gctrace=1 ./main
 gc 1 @0.017s 8%: 0.021+3.2+0.10+0.15+0.86 ms clock, 0.043+3.2+0+2.2/0.002/0.009+1.7 ms cpu, 5->6->1 MB, 4 MB goal, 4 P
 gc 2 @0.026s 12%: 0.11+4.9+0.12+1.6+0.54 ms clock, 0.23+4.9+0+3.0/0.50/0+1.0 ms cpu, 4->6->3 MB, 6 MB goal, 4 P
 gc 3 @0.035s 14%: 0.031+3.3+0.76+0.17+0.28 ms clock, 0.093+3.3+0+2.7/0.012/0+0.84 ms cpu, 4->5->3 MB, 3 MB goal, 4 P
 gc 4 @0.042s 17%: 0.067+5.1+0.15+0.29+0.95 ms clock, 0.20+5.1+0+3.0/0/0.070+2.8 ms cpu, 4->5->4 MB, 4 MB goal, 4 P
 gc 5 @0.051s 21%: 0.029+5.6+0.33+0.62+1.5 ms clock, 0.11+5.6+0+3.3/0.006/0.002+6.0 ms cpu, 5->6->4 MB, 5 MB goal, 4 P
 gc 6 @0.061s 23%: 0.080+7.6+0.17+0.22+0.45 ms clock, 0.32+7.6+0+5.4/0.001/0.11+1.8 ms cpu, 6->6->5 MB, 7 MB goal, 4 P
 gc 7 @0.071s 25%: 0.59+5.9+0.017+0.15+0.96 ms clock, 2.3+5.9+0+3.8/0.004/0.042+3.8 ms cpu, 6->8->6 MB, 8 MB goal, 4 P

The trace output gives a general measure of GC activity.

DEMO: Show `Homeopathix` with `GODEBUG=gctrace=1` enabled

_Recommendation_: use this env var in production, it has no performance impact.


* Garbage collector tuning

The Go runtime provides one environment variable to tune the GC, `GOGC`.

The formula for GOGC is as follows.

    goal = reachable * (1 + GOGC/100)

For example, if we currently have a 256MB heap, and `GOGC=100` (the default), when the heap fills up it will grow to

    512MB = 256MB * (1 + 100/100)

- Values of `GOGC` greater than 100 causes the heap to grow faster, reducing the pressure on the GC.
- Values of `GOGC` less than 100 cause the heap to grow slowly, increasing the pressure on the GC.

The default value of 100 is _just_a_guide_. you should choose your own value _after_profiling_your_application_with_production_loads_.


* Reduce allocations

Make sure your APIs allow the caller to reduce the amount of garbage generated.

Consider these two Read methods

    func (r *Reader) Read() ([]byte, error)
    func (r *Reader) Read(buf []byte) (int, error)

The first Read method takes no arguments and returns some data as a `[]byte`. The second takes a `[]byte` buffer and returns the amount of bytes read.

The first Read method will _always_ allocate a buffer, putting pressure on the GC. The second fills the buffer it was given.

* Preallocate slices if the length is known

Append is convenient, but wasteful.

What is the capacity of `b` after we append one more item to it?

.play examples/grow/grow.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

If you use the append pattern you could be copying a lot of data and creating a lot of garbage.


* Preallocate slices if the length is known (cont.)

If know know the length of the slice beforehand, then pre-allocate the target to avoid copying and to make sure the target is exactly the right size.

_Before:_

     var s []string
     for _, v := range fn() {
            s = append(s, v)
     }
     return s

_After:_

     vals := fn()
     s := make([]string, len(vals))
     for i, v := range vals {
            s[i] = v
     }
     return s


* Using sync.Pool

The `sync` package comes with a `sync.Pool` type which is used to reuse common objects.

`sync.Pool` has no fixed size or maximum capacity. You add to it and take from it until a GC happens, then it is emptied unconditionally.

.code examples/syncpool/pool.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

*Warning*: `sync.Pool` is not a cache. It can and will be emptied _at_any_time_.

Do not place important items in a `sync.Pool`, they will be discarded.


* Conclusion

* Follow SRE Principles 

Start with the simplest possible code.

_Measure_. Profile your code to identify the bottlenecks, _do_not_guess_.

If performance is good, _stop_. You don't need to optimise everything, only the hottest parts of your code.

As your application grows, or your traffic pattern evolves, the performance hot spots will change.

Don't leave complex code that is not performance critical, rewrite it with simpler operations if the bottleneck moves elsewhere.

Pay very close attention to allocations, avoid unnecessary allocation where possible.
